'Sup guise?

I wrote a little command-line utility to extract the amperage data 
and corresponding time stamps and put it into a new file. In this 
directory are the amp data, as well as my command-line utility. It 
may be the hackiest code I've ever written, but it's super early in 
the AM and it works. 

I'm not super familiar with functions in bash yet, so I just wrote 
two files. 

One, "data conversion.sh" cycles through the current 
directory looking for raw files. If it sees one, it checks to make 
sure the file hasn't yet been converted (in case we get more data), 
and if it hasn't, it pulls out all the amperage data and corresponding 
timestamps and copies them into a new .csv file. 

The other is essentially a technician, who brings his data converter 
with him to all subdirectories he's called in, converts any data 
he finds, and puts it all in an appropriately named directory.

If we get more data and you want to use it, just put them both in 
the top directory and call driver.sh. 

Like I said, it's a hack. In any case, we now have clean amp data 
to work with.
